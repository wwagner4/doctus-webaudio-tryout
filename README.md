### Experiments with the webaudio api

Trying out the components of the webaudio api and how they work together

[click here to see how it works. http://entelijan.net/webaudio/](http://entelijan.net/webaudio/)

#### Ideas
* Implemet some sound where the cutoff frequency is controlled by the pitch, an envelope and/or a modulator
* Make a metallic sound using inharmonic partials
* Designe a reusable ADSR envelope
* Make a reusable noise AudioNode
* Synchronize a new sequence of of notes with another already plying sequence
* Tryout some modulated delay. Do this differently on the left and right output to widen the sound.

#### TODOS
* Switch to latest version of scalaJS
* Fix the 'mouse leave canvas' bug in doctus.
